    <h1 class="gcPromoText">What is GirlCode?</h1>
    <h3>GirlCode is an event WIC hosts two Saturdays per semester where we teach middleschool-aged girls how to code and
        use hardware such as Raspberry Pi's and Micro:Bits. This is a great opportunity for our members to give the younger
        generation an opportunity to become passionate about computers.
    </h3>

    <h1 class="gcPromoText">Testimonies</h1>
    <h3>"GirlCode made me want to join Women in Computing. I have always had a passion of teaching as well as Computer Science.
        With GirlCode, I've been able to pursue this passion, as well as help younger girls learn how to code. I've enjoyed this 
        so much, that I've become the Outreach Chair for two years to help lead these events. I highly recommend trying this out 
        for anyone who wants to help girls become passionate about computers." - Christina Sorensen

        "I enjoy volunteering at GirlCode because I love sharing my passion for electrical engineering with the next generation.
        I wish I had an opportunity like this when I was younger, so being able to introduce these girls to hardware at an early 
        age is incredibly rewarding." - Maddie Watson
